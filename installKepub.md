# Kobo EPUB

Kobo devices can render native epub files, but the features while reading are limited and navigation is slow.
In order to get all the features available, we need to have books in Kobos *.kepub.epub format.

## On the fly: Epub > Kepub

The most end-user friendly way.

- Install Kobo Touch Extended:

- KTE will convert books on-the-fly, while sending to a device, into kepub format


## CLI Binary

Faster and friendlier for batch processing:
